# Simple List
A simple list provides a list of selectable items that can be shown within a page. Each item is described by a text label. The list may be divided into logical sections by introducing group headers.

## Usage
A simple list is used when the information presented does not follow a specific pattern, or does not require bullets to differentiate one list item from another.

```html
<pf-simple-list>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Blue</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Green</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Magenta</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Orange</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Purple</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Pink</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Red</pf-simple-list-option>
  <pf-simple-list-option>Yellow</pf-simple-list-option>
</pf-simple-list>
```
